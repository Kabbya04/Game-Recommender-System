**Omni** is a content-based game recommender system designed to suggest video games based on a user's input game name. It leverages **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) techniques to analyze game descriptions and recommend similar games, helping gamers discover new titles that match their interests. It also uses the SVM model to predict the recommended games' potential likelihood and provides a status (e.g. Highly Recommended or Casually Recommended).
